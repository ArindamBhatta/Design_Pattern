# Singleton Pattern

> when we create one object and call many time and we get same object Every time

### steps: -

1. Constructor must be private. that means outside of the class we don't have any permission to create an object

2. Then we create a function that access outside of the class scope getArindam() and hear we create one object instance and store this prop in class global scope with a condition
